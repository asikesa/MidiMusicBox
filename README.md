# MidiMusicBox
Turn midi files into PDF scores in the browser for DIY paper music boxes like the Kikkerland Make your own music box kit.
Uses MIDIFile MIDIEvent and PDFKit

## Roadmap
- Create instructional video to better explain how to use the site
- Support custom / saved layouts to support a larger variety of music boxes
- Test midi files generated from a variety of applications
- (Maybe) Create a GUI to allow editing / creating scores from scratch
